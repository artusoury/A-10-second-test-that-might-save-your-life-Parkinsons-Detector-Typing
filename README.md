A 10-second test that might save your life' is a Python app that measures typing speed fluctuations, potentially flagging early signs of neurodegenerative diseases. It's privacy-friendly and user-centric. Use, share, and contribute to its improvement.


This project features an application that records the time taken for a user to press ten keys on their keyboard. It logs the times in a CSV file and generates a plot of the average typing time over time after every fifth log.

The purpose of this application is to track any significant or sudden changes in typing speed, which might be an early warning sign of certain neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease. This might be especially useful for people who have a family history of such diseases.

Please note: This application is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.

The application is built with Python, using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, and Matplotlib for generating the plots.

This application respects user privacy. It does not record which keys are being pressed; it only records the time between key presses and releases. The test only operates within its own application window.

Feel free to download, use, and share this application. If you have any suggestions for improvement, or if you encounter any issues, please let us know.
